    "text": "The gig economy, characterised by short-term contracts and freelance work as opposed to permanent jobs, has transformed the labour market in ways economists are still trying to fully comprehend. Proponents argue that it offers unprecedented flexibility and autonomy — workers can set their own hours and take on multiple clients. Critics, however, point to the erosion of workers' rights: no sick pay, no holiday entitlement, and no guaranteed minimum hours. A 2023 report found that gig workers earn on average 25% less per hour than their permanently employed counterparts when accounting for unpaid downtime between gigs.",

      "A. They earn 25% more than permanent employees due to flexibility bonuses.",
      "B. Their hourly earnings are comparable to those of permanent employees.",
      "C. When unpaid gaps are factored in, they earn less than permanent workers.",

    "text": "HOST: Today on 'Green Futures' we speak with marine biologist Dr. Clara Voss about coral reef restoration. Dr. Voss, how hopeful are you?\nDR. VOSS: Cautiously optimistic. The lab-grown coral techniques we've been piloting show a 70% survival rate after transplantation — that's a significant improvement from the 30% we saw a decade ago. But I want to be honest: we can restore reefs all we like, but if ocean temperatures keep rising due to climate change, those restored corals will bleach again within years. Restoration is a stopgap, not a solution.\nHOST: What's the most promising development you've seen recently?\nDR. VOSS: Thermal-resistant coral strains. Researchers in Hawaii and Australia have been selectively breeding corals that can tolerate warmer temperatures. It's essentially assisted evolution. If we can scale that up, we might be able to buy enough time for broader climate action to take effect.",
