    "text": "The gig economy, characterised by short-term contracts and freelance work as opposed to permanent jobs, has transformed the labour market in ways economists are still trying to fully comprehend. Proponents argue that it offers unprecedented flexibility and autonomy — workers can set their own hours and take on multiple clients. Critics, however, point to the erosion of workers' rights: no sick pay, no holiday entitlement, and no guaranteed minimum hours. A 2023 report found that gig workers earn on average 25% less per hour than their permanently employed counterparts when accounting for unpaid downtime between gigs.",

The lab-grown coral techniques we've been piloting show a 70% survival rate after transplantation — that's a significant improvement from the 30% we saw a decade ago. But I want to be honest: we can restore reefs all we like, but if ocean temperatures keep rising due to climate change, those restored corals will bleach again within years. Restoration is a stopgap, not a solution.\nHOST: What's the most promising development you've seen recently?\nDR. VOSS: Thermal-resistant coral strains. Researchers in Hawaii and Australia have been selectively breeding corals that can tolerate warmer temperatures. It's essentially assisted evolution. If we can scale that up, we might be able to buy enough time for broader climate action to take effect.",

    "text": "HOST: Welcome back. Today we're joined by Professor Angela Reed, an expert in behavioural economics. Professor Reed, why do people consistently make poor financial decisions even when they know better?\nPROF. REED: That's the central puzzle of our field. The traditional economic model assumes that people are rational actors who weigh up costs and benefits and make optimal choices. But decades of research shows this simply isn't true. We are heavily influenced by cognitive biases — mental shortcuts that served us well on the African savannah but trip us up in modern financial markets. The most pervasive is present bias: we massively overvalue immediate rewards compared to future ones. That's why someone knows they should save for retirement but spends the money on an impulse purchase instead.\nHOST: Is there a way to counteract these biases?\nPROF. REED: Absolutely. The most effective intervention is what we call 'choice architecture' — designing the environment so that the default option is the beneficial one. For example, automatically enrolling employees in pension schemes dramatically increases participation, even though opting out is equally simple. The key insight is that people don't always choose what they prefer — they often choose what's easiest.",

My brain kept searching for sounds to process. After about two weeks, I stopped noticing it.

The technology has genuine benefits — finding missing children, identifying terrorists, reuniting families. But the risks are significant and, I'd argue, currently outweigh the benefits in many applications. Studies have repeatedly shown accuracy rates drop dramatically for darker skin tones and for women, which raises serious concerns about discriminatory policing. Several US cities have already banned it for law enforcement use. What troubles me most is the chilling effect on public behaviour — if people know they're being identified in real time, it changes how freely they move and assemble.\nHOST: Can regulation solve these problems?\nDR.

The 40-hour week was standardised in the early 20th century, primarily in manufacturing contexts. Henry Ford is often credited with popularising it — not for humanitarian reasons, but because he found workers were more productive with rest days. The intellectual and creative work that dominates modern economies has fundamentally different demands. Research consistently shows that knowledge workers produce their best output in 4 to 6 hours of focused work per day. Beyond that, productivity curves downward sharply. Countries piloting 4-day weeks have reported maintained or improved output alongside dramatic improvements in employee wellbeing.\nINTERVIEWER: Is this universally applicable?\nPROF.

    "text": "The placebo effect — the measurable, positive health outcome that results from a patient receiving an inert treatment while believing it to be real — has long been dismissed as 'mere psychology'. Yet accumulating research suggests it is a potent physiological phenomenon. Patients given sugar pills for chronic pain show real reductions in pain, accompanied by measurable changes in brain activity and the release of endogenous opioids. More surprising still, studies by Harvard researcher Ted Kaptchuk have shown that 'open-label placebos' — inert treatments given to patients who are fully informed they are receiving a placebo — can also produce significant symptom relief. The mechanism remains poorly understood, but the implications for medicine are considerable.",

Teachers in Finland are highly respected professionals, drawn from the top third of graduates, and are given significant autonomy over curriculum and teaching methods.

    "text": "The sharing economy, exemplified by companies like Airbnb and Uber, promised to democratise access to underused assets and supplement incomes for ordinary people. In practice, however, the picture is more complicated.

Meanwhile, Uber and similar platforms have faced criticism for reclassifying employees as independent contractors to avoid providing benefits, leading to several landmark legal battles in the UK, US, and EU.

By allowing scientists to 'cut and paste' specific sections of DNA with unprecedented precision, it holds promise for curing genetic diseases from sickle cell anaemia to certain cancers. However, the technology raises profound ethical questions. In 2018, Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced the birth of the world's first gene-edited babies — twin girls whose embryos had been altered to resist HIV infection. The announcement provoked near-universal condemnation from the scientific community, not because of the goal, but because the experiment bypassed established ethical protocols and consent procedures, and because the long-term implications for the children's health remain unknown.",
    "question": "Why did the scientific community condemn He Jiankui's experiment?",
    "options": [
      "A. Because the goal of preventing HIV was considered unethical.",
      "B. Because the experiment failed to produce any viable results.",
      "C. Because proper ethical procedures were not followed and long-term effects are unknown.",
      "D. Because CRISPR technology was not yet sufficiently developed for human application."
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Tekst mówi: potępiono nie za cel, lecz za 'bypassed established ethical protocols' i nieznane konsekwencje zdrowotne."

    "text": "MODERATOR: Our guest today is urban planner Yusuf Demir, who has been working on 15-minute city concepts. Yusuf, can you explain the idea?\nYUSUF: The 15-minute city is a vision of urban life where everything you need — work, shopping, healthcare, education, leisure — is accessible within a 15-minute walk or cycle from your home. It's not a new concept; it draws on ideas from Jane Jacobs and others going back to the 1960s. But it's gaining traction partly because of the pandemic, which showed us that many people function perfectly well without long commutes, and partly because of climate concerns.\nMODERATOR: Are there critics?\nYUSUF: Absolutely. The main critique from the right is that it restricts freedom of movement and creates 'urban islands'. That's largely a misrepresentation — nobody is proposing to stop people travelling; the idea is to ensure that not travelling is a viable choice. A more substantive concern is about affordability: if central areas are made more desirable, property prices rise and lower-income residents can be displaced. Getting that balance right is the real challenge.",

    "text": "HOST: Today we speak with architect Fatima Zahra about biophilic design. Fatima, can you explain the concept?\nFATIMA: Biophilic design is the practice of incorporating natural elements into built environments — not as decoration, but as core structural and psychological features. We're talking about natural light, living plant walls, water features, natural materials like wood and stone, and views of the outdoors. The premise is that human beings evolved in natural environments over hundreds of thousands of years and are psychologically and physiologically adapted to them. Disconnecting people from nature — as most modern buildings do — has measurable costs: increased stress, reduced concentration, lower wellbeing.\nHOST: Is there evidence for this?\nFATIMA: Considerable evidence. Studies of hospital patients show faster recovery rates in rooms with natural views. Office workers in biophilically designed spaces show up to 15% higher productivity and significantly lower rates of absenteeism.
